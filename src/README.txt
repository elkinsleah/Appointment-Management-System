Directions on how to run the program:

Once the run button is selected in IntelliJ, the program is initialized and the user is brought to the Login Screen. The language on the Login Screen can be changed to French depending on the userâ€™s computer language setting.
The user is asked to enter a username and password that matches the username and password in the database. Usernames and passwords include test, user and admin.

Once a valid username and password is entered, a popup box appears letting the user know whether there is an appointment within the next 15 minutes. The user is then brought to the Main Screen.
This screen displays all appointments. There are also buttons that the user can select from to be directed to a different screen. The user can use the buttons to add a new appointment, update an existing
appointment, or delete an appointment. There is also a button that will take the user to the Reports Screen.

Another button on the Main Screen will take the user to the Customers Screen where all the customers are displayed.
The user can add a new customer, update an existing customer, or delete a customer. The user can also log out from the Main Screen and log back in as a different user. All screens have a button that allows the user
to return to the Main Screen if they want to.

Description of additional report:

For my additional report, I chose to display the number of appointment hours for each customer. It displays the name of the customer and the length of all of their appointments.
I felt like knowing the total amount of time each customer had for their appointments is something an office or company would want to have a report of in a real world situation.
